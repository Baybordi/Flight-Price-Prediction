Flight Price Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict flight prices using a Random Forest Regressor. The model utilizes k-fold cross-validation to evaluate performance and is trained on the dataset after preprocessing and imputation of missing values.

Project Overview
The project aims to predict flight prices using a Random Forest model, which is a powerful ensemble learning method. The dataset used for training contains various features related to flight details. The model is trained and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, and the R-squared score is used as a performance metric.

Libraries and Dependencies
This project uses several key libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and model evaluation:

scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics
pandas and numpy for data processing (not shown in the code snippet but required for the data preparation)
Model Description
The model uses a RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn to predict flight prices. The Random Forest model is configured with the following hyperparameters:

n_estimators=100: Number of trees in the forest.
max_depth=10: Maximum depth of the trees.
random_state=42: A fixed seed to ensure reproducibility.
Cross-Validation
We use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is split into 5 parts, and the model is trained on 4 parts while testing on the remaining part. This process is repeated 5 times, and the average performance is reported.
