Flight Price Prediction with Random Forest ðŸš€
Overview
This project aims to predict flight prices using a Random Forest Regressor. By leveraging the power of ensemble learning and applying k-fold cross-validation, the model is optimized for accuracy and robustness. The dataset is preprocessed and imputed for missing values, and the model's performance is evaluated based on the R-squared score.

Key Features
âœ… Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble learning model used for predicting continuous variables like flight prices.
âœ… Cross-Validation: Implements 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
âœ… R-squared Metric: Uses R-squared to assess the quality of predictions and model fit.
âœ… Efficient Model Training: The model is trained on imputed data for better accuracy and handling of missing values.
âœ… Scalable: The Random Forest algorithm is suitable for large datasets and can easily be extended to other use cases.

Results & Insights
ðŸ“Œ Cross-validated R-squared scores: The model demonstrates high predictive accuracy across multiple folds, with R-squared scores ranging from 0.82 to 0.88.
ðŸ“Œ Final R-squared score: After training on the entire dataset, the Random Forest model achieved an R-squared score of 0.8542, indicating that it can explain 85.42% of the variance in flight prices.
ðŸ“Œ Imputed Data Handling: The model uses imputed data to handle missing values effectively, ensuring that the predictions are not biased by incomplete information.
Future Work
ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore tuning the Random Forest parameters like n_estimators and max_depth to improve model performance further.
ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering: Experiment with additional features like flight duration, airline, or departure time to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power.
ðŸ”¹ Comparison with Other Models: Compare the performance of Random Forest with other models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost to assess which provides the best results for flight price prediction.
